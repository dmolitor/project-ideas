## Coarsened Exact Matching
**Status**: ðŸŸ¨

Marry cutting-edge supervised discretion algorithms [@kurgan_caim_2004]
(need to find truly cutting-edge methods, but this seems to be the canonical
example) with coarsened exact matching (CEM) [@iacus_causal_2012] to improve
the recovery of true causal parameter(s) with CEM.
